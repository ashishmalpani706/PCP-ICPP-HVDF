This project demonstrates PCP, ICPP and HVDF scheduling algorithms.

Go to the src directory in the root directory and then execute the following commands

To compile: javac Run.java

To run: java Run <scheduler> 

NOTE: the value of the scheduler should be in double quotes

Scheduler can be pcp, icpp or hvdf.
For Example: java Run "pcp" or java Run "icpp" or java Run "hvdf"

The output is also saved to a file output.txt in the main directory as well as printed on the console

There are three files associated with the schedulers

PCP and ICPP uses 'input.txt' for tasks and 'input2.txt' for resources

HVDF uses the file 'input3.txt' for tasks
