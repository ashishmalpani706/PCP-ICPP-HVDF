#This project demonstrates PCP, ICPP and HVDF scheduling algorithms.
#
#To compile: javac Run.java
#
#To run: java Run \"\<scheduler\>\" 
#
#NOTE: the value of the scheduler should be in double quotes
#
#Scheduler can be pcp, icpp or hvdf.
#For Example: java Run \"pcp\" or java Run \"icpp\" or java Run \"hvdf\"
#
#If you want to save the output to a file - uncomment outputToAFile(); on line 21 in the file Run.java
#
#There are three files associated with the schedulers
#
#PCP and ICPP uses \'input.txt\' for tasks and \'input2.txt\' for resources
#
#HVDF uses the file \'input3.txt\' for tasks
